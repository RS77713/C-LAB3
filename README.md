C++ LAB N3. Loops. while and do..while statements.

Task:

Create an algorithm, that solves individual task by using loops. Individual task number is being defined as in previous labs.
In Visual Studio environment create a console program in C/C++ based on created algorithm by using while or/and do..while statements. If individual task is about number processing then it is not allowed to use strings for number representation (e.g. in tasks N 1, 6, 7, 11, 13 from the first list)!

+ //Task 10 -  Input: integer numbers a, b, c, d. Find all integer roots of equation ax³+bx²+cx+d=0 (search roots among possible divisors of number d).
